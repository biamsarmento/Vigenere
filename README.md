# 🔐 Project Vigenère Cipher (Encryptor & Decryptor)

## 📖 About the Project

The **Vigenère Cipher** is a classical encryption algorithm that enhances the security of text-based messages using a **polyalphabetic substitution method**. This project implements both **encryption** and **decryption** functionalities, allowing users to securely encode and decode messages using a secret key.

### Features:
- **Encryption**: Converts plaintext into ciphertext using a repeating keyword.  
- **Decryption**: Restores the original message from the encrypted text when provided with the correct key.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple input fields for text and key entry.  

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project was to implement the **Vigenère Cipher algorithm** while reinforcing concepts related to **cryptography, string manipulation, and user interaction**. It serves as a learning tool for understanding **classic encryption techniques** and how they can be applied in modern contexts.
